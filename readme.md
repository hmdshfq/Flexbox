# Implementing CSS Flexbox

## Center Me

In this demo, a div has been centered inside another div container using CSS flexbox. The div is centered horizontally as well as vertically. It will stay like that no matter what is the size of the viewport.

## Nice Flow 

In this demo, six divs of fixed width and height are spaced evenly using CSS flexbox. The flexbox's wrap property is used to move the div boxes to the next line when the viewport becomes less than their combined width.

## View Ports - Using CSS flexbox and media queries to make the responsive navbar

In this demo, when the viewport is greater than 800px, the webpage will display all the links to the top-right of the page. When the viewport is between 500px and 800px, the links will be displayed in the middle of the webpage. When the viewport is less than 500px then the links will be stacked in a column.

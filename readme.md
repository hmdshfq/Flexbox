# Implementing CSS Flexbox

## View Ports - Using CSS flexbox and media queries to make responsive navbar

In this demo the webpage will display all the links to the top-right of the page when the viewport is greater than 800px. When the viewport is between 500px and 800px, the links will be displayed in the middle of the webpage. When the viewport is less than 500px then the links will be stacked in a column.
